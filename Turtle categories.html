        <h1>TURTLES AND TORTOISES IN SRI LANKA</h1>
        <p>One of the few nations in the world that can claim to be home to the three main species of
            chelonians—freshwater terrapins, land tortoises, and marine turtles—is Sri Lanka. Despite the custom, the
            term "turtle" is frequently used to describe all Chelonians.</p>

        <h2>The waters of Sri Lanka are home to five of the world's seven species of marine turtles.</h2>
        <p>
            Around 1,585 km of Sri Lanka's coastline are made up of sandy beaches, sizable lagoons, estuaries,
            mangroves, coastal marshes, and dunes. Approximately 488,675 square kilometers of sea territory fall under
            its purview. This island is situated in the Gulf of Mannar, beneath the southernmost tip of India, and is
            isolated from the South Asian continent by its shallow waters.<br>
            These waters are home to the green, olive ridley, loggerhead, leatherback, and hawksbill marine turtle
            species. These five species have perfect habitats on and around the island thanks to the warm sea, coral
            reefs, sea grass beds, and excellent nesting beaches.

            <h3>Olive Ridley Turtle - Lepidochelys olivacea</h3>
            <p>
                Olive Ridley The Lepidochelys olivacea sea turtle is a species that lives in the warm Indian Ocean seas.
                It is a relatively little creature with an upper exoskeleton in the form of a black heart that matures
                to an olive green color. It weighs little more than 50 kilograms and measures 60 to 70 centimeters on
                average in length. The Olive Ridley sea turtle, noted for being the one that is most frequently
                encountered, is known for arriving on land in huge groups at once known as "arribada" in order to lay
                their eggs. The Olive Ridley has a lifespan of 50 years and mostly consumes jellyfish, shrimp, mollusks,
                and fish.<br><br>

            <h3>Leatherback Turtle - Dermochelys coriacea</h3>
            <p>
                The Leatherback Sea turtle (Dermochelys coriacea) is regarded as the fourth-heaviest modern reptile and
                the largest living turtle. It may be identified by its big, teardrop-shaped body that is a massive shade
                of grayish-black and is coated in skin and greasy flesh, as well as by the seven distinct ridges that
                run along its body from front to back. The leatherback sea turtle can reach heights of up to seven feet
                (two meters) and can weigh over two thousand pounds (900 kilograms). It can swim swiftly through the
                water thanks to its hydrodynamic body structure and a sizable pair of front flippers because it
                primarily feeds on jellyfish and other small marine invertebrates.<br><br>

            <p>
                The Green turtle (Chelonia mydas), one of the biggest marine turtles ever recorded, is the one that is
                most frequently spotted in Sri Lanka. It may be identified by its flattened body, which is encased in a
                tear-shaped shell that is blackish grey in color, a smaller head than the loggerhead turtle, and a pair
                of enormous flippers that resemble paddles. The average adult turtle weighs between 68 and 190 kg,
                however rare species can reach weights of 315 kg. Its name comes from the layers of green-colored fat
                that are present beneath its shell. They thrive mostly in tropical ocean conditions, eating solely
                marine plants like algae and sea grass before returning to the beach to lay eggs.<br><br>

            <h3>Hawksbill Turtle - Eretmochelys imbricata</h3>
            <p>
                The World Conservation Union has listed the hawksbill turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata) as critically
                endangered due to poaching for its beautiful, commercially valuable "tortoise-shell," human consumption
                of tortoise flesh and eggs, and the turtle becoming entangled in fishing gear. It has a dark golden
                brown color with reddish orange streaks, and its thick scutes, which make up its hard upper shell, are
                what make it so unusual. The Hawksbill turtle has a head that is elongated and tapers into a pointed
                beak that resembles a hawk. It is tiny to medium in size. It primarily lives in shallow lagoons and
                coral reefs, where it eats sponges, fish, sea anemones, and jellyfish, among other things.<br><br>

            <p>
                The Caretta caretta, also known as the loggerhead sea turtle, has a reddish brown shell with a top shell
                that resembles a small heart and a sizeable head. A typical adult is three feet long and weighs about
                113 kilograms (250 pounds).The females of these marine reptiles briefly come ashore to lay their eggs in
                bays, lagoons, and salt marshes, although they are primarily found in salt water, often hundreds of
                kilometres out at sea. Being carnivores, they mostly eat marine invertebrates, particularly crabs with
                hard shells, which they eat with their mighty jaws. The lifespan of a loggerhead sea turtle is estimated
                to be 50 years.<br><br>
