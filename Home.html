          <p>The best way to explore Sri Lanka, the teardrop-shaped island that is home to five of the seven varieties
            of sea turtle, is to volunteer for sea turtle conservation there. Unfortunately, constant vigilance is
            required at Sri Lanka's numerous nesting beaches to safeguard the nests from all types of poachers. Discover
            this extraordinary nation while learning about a new culture and contributing to the preservation of the
            maritime environment.<br>

            Your major goal as a volunteer for sea turtle conservation in Sri Lanka is to save young turtles, their
            nests, and to ensure their general well at the hatcheries. In Sri Lanka, patrol the beaches, watch out for
            nests, take care of newborn turtles, then release the recovered turtles into the Indian Ocean.

          <h1>Why are the Sea Turtles important?</h1>

          <h3>CORAL REEFS</h3>
          <p>Hawksbills live on coral reefs and are known for only consuming a few types of sea sponges. The variety of
            life on the reef is increased by this diet, which enables the growth of uncommon forms of sponges. Without
            Hawksbills, sponges might overgrow, suffocate, and kill slow-growing corals. The Hawksbill's position on the
            reef has grown even more important as it faces increasing threats from climate change and other negative
            factors.
          </p>

          <h3>BEACHES</h3>
          <p>Additionally, sea turtles benefit the water. By laying their eggs on the sand, sea turtles that are nesting
            benefit beaches. Eggshells and unhatched eggs that are left behind supply vital nutrients that feed beach
            grasses and other dune flora, which stabilizes dunes and helps prevent coastal erosion.
          </p>

          <h3>TURTLE PREDATORS</h3>
          <p>At every stage of their lives, sea turtles are prey for various creatures. Fish, land mammals, birds,
            crabs, and crab larvae all eat hatchlings. Apex predators like sharks and orcas feed on adult sea turtles.
          </p>

          <h3>HELPING OTHERS</h3>
          <p>A variety of "aquatic hitchhikers" including barnacles and other small crustaceans, remoras, algae, and
            diatoms all find a home in the habitats of sea turtles. Sea turtles aid in the transportation of these
            species since they make lengthy migrations. Additionally, fish use them as a sort of canopy to protect
            themselves from predators. Sea turtles occasionally act as a sort of reptilian aircraft carrier for seabirds
            when they are at the surface of the water to breathe or rest.
            <br>
            In addition to playing a crucial ecological purpose, sea turtles are among the most endearing creatures on
            the world. Everyone appears to adore marine turtles. However, they are more than just charismatic.
          </p>

          <h3>IMPORTANCE TO HUMANS</h3>
          <p>For numerous coastal communities all around the world, sea turtles have a significant cultural
            significance. They are revered or regarded as ancestors in many indigenous cultures. They are also a
            significant source of revenue for coastal people through Sri Lankan ecotourism, which is a significant and
            growing component of the country's tourism industry. According to research, selling sea turtle parts (eggs,
            meat, and shells) can bring in three times as much money as selling them whole, making them more valuable
            alive than dead.
            <br>
            They are a source of wonder and inspiration. It is genuinely wonderful and a memorable experience to see
            them push themselves up a beach to nest, swim through a reef, or watch hatchlings sprint to the sea. We
            couldn't have a blue earth without sea turtles.<br><br>

          <h1>What can we do to save the Sea Turtles of Sri Lanka?</h1>
          <ul>
            <li>Reduce marine debris that could trap or unintentionally ingest sea turtles.</li>
            <li>To keep our beaches and ocean clean, take part in coastal cleanups and cut back on plastic consumption.
              Sea turtles and other marine life could be harmed by trash in the water.</li>
            <li>Bring shopping bags and reusable water bottles with you. Avoid releasing balloons into the air because
              they will probably wind up in the water where sea turtles may mistake them for prey and eat them.</li>
            <li>Keep sea turtle nesting beaches secure and dark. Turn off, cover, or reroute any lights that can be seen
              from the shore. Sea turtle hatchlings are confused by lights, and females that are nesting are deterred
              from coming to the shore to lay their eggs.</li>
            <li>Avoid tampering with turtle nests, young, or nesting turtles. Participate in organized sea turtle
              watching events that understand how to monitor sea turtles safely. Talk to the Mahoora Guys; they are the
              authorities on this. And you'll notice...</li>
            <li>In order to prevent sea turtles from being turned away, remove recreational beach equipment including
              chairs, umbrellas, and boats at night.
              Before you depart the beach, patch up any holes and destroy any sandcastles. They could become a barrier
              for hatchlings or turtles that are building nests.<br><br></li>
